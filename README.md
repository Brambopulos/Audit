The Cyber Risk Assessment leverages native Operating System capabilities to collect information that represents exigent and hygiene risks in the configuration and use of servers, workstations, and laptops/tablets that organizational processes depend upon.

By collecting simple information with precise articulation of requisite metadata from active and scheduled processes, network configuration and activity, services build details, and user activity history and rights - from a representative population of the managed estate, statistical analysis of the results can be performed.  Comparing findings by organizational function or groupings (endpoint, user, geography, subnet, or etc.) enables impact analysis of identified (exigent and hygiene) risks.

Unlike traditional assessments that are based on executive questionnaires, or vulnerability assessments that focus upon "risk vectors" (of network, identity, or endpoint), the Cyber Risk Assessment produces evidence from the collected information that can be used to substantiate security posture & program status - and plan for improvement of factors that relate to the dependency of organizational processes upon related systems.

The Cyber Risk Assessment is intended to produce a baseline from evidence, of operational risk in context (exigent/hygiene factor(s) x impact).
